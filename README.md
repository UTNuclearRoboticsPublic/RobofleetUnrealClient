# RobofleetUnrealClient
Client-side code for Robofleet in the form of an Unreal Engine module.
It is nominally a stripped down clone of [robofleet_client](https://github.com/ut-amrl/robofleet_client), with ROS dependencies and message scheduling removed.

# Code Overview
This Module, other Robofleet clients, and the Robofleet server makes used of flatbuffers and a common library to facilitate common functions. 
These shared components are detailed here.


### flatbuffers and generated schemas
The flatbuffers library is a way to serialize and package data across platforms. The 'blueprint' for how to encode and decode these structures is defined in the flatbuffer schema, 
which is specified in `robofleet_client_lib/include/schema_generated.h`. 

### robofleet_client_lib
This is a shared library that all existing robofleet clients use, in varying degrees. It includes it's own `decode` and `encode` functions that can be defined and used cross-platform.
Additionally, it defines a number of C++ structs in `message_structs.h` that are useful once a flatbuffer object is received and decoded.

### robofleet_client
While not used directly in this Module, it's notable to mention that if you're using robofleet with robots, they will likely be using [this](https://github.com/ut-amrl/robofleet_client) as their client. 
Therefore, you should be aware that new functionality may need to be added here for your robot to publish new data.


## Adding New Messages
When adding new message support to the Robofleet system, these are the general steps that need to be carried out:
1. Check the following directory to see if the flatbuffer definitions for the message you want to add already exists (```/Private/robofleet_client_lib/include/msg_schemas```). If the schema does not exist, follow the next steps to create the schema and add it to the ```msg_schemas``` directory. Click through the drop down menus for images from an example.

When everything is tested, you'll need to create a pull request for each of the three libraries you modified to add support.
